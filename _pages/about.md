## Biography
I am an **Associate Professor** (*SSD* **INFO-01/A**, *ex* **INF/01 – Computer Science**) in the [Department of Enterprise Engineering](https://dii.uniroma2.it/) at the [University of Rome “Tor Vergata”](http://web.uniroma2.it/).  
I lead the **[Semantic Analytics Group (SAG)](http://sag.art.uniroma2.it)** and contribute to the **[Artificial Intelligence at Tor Vergata (ART)](https://art.uniroma2.it/)** network.
  
My work sits at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Multimodality**, with a consistent focus on **transparency**, **sustainability**, and **impactful applications**.

## Research Vision
I pursue methods that connect **rigorous learning theory** with **deployable AI systems**.  
The common thread is to make neural architectures **transparent, sustainable, and multimodal**, while scaling to real data and real users.

**Core areas**
- **Large Language Models & Generative AI** — instruction tuning, continual and multi-task learning, efficient adaptation, evaluation.  
- **Machine Learning for NLP** — kernel methods and neural networks; syntactic/semantic parsing; information extraction.  
- **Semantic Search & Evidence-based AI** — retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fact verification, adaptive IR.  
- **Multimodality & Grounding** — language–vision models for captioning, VQA, and situated reasoning.  
- **Human–Robot Interaction** — spoken language understanding and context-aware, adaptive interfaces.  
- **Ethics & Transparency** — interpretability, fairness, and “ethics-by-design” methodologies.
