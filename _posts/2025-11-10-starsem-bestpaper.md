We are thrilled to announce that our paper  

**[“Injecting Frame Semantics into Large Language Models via Prompt-Based Fine-Tuning”](https://aclanthology.org/2025.starsem-1.3/)**

has received the **Best Paper Award** at ***SEM 2025 (The Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics)**. 🎉


The paper introduces a novel approach for injecting **Frame Semantics** into **Large Language Models (LLMs)** using **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA)**. We're honoured by this recognition and grateful to the SEM committee and reviewers for their support.
